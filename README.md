## Mulka: A Property Investment Platform

[Mulka](https://mulka.herokuapp.com/) is a platform that enable investors to own units of a property by acquiring units they can afford. This platform was originally built using the MEN (Mongo, Node, Express) stack (see [Bricalot](https://github.com/jkups/bricalot)) and this is an attempt to build the solution using a different stack. The platform is mobile ready and was built with the following tools.
